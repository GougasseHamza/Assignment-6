Comments : 

I think i worked on dp fairly well, i believe i still have to get on advanced dp , ( segment trees dp , dp on trees, graphs, bitwise dp ) , but i'm starting to get its idea, I did a lot of bitmasks and bitwise problems ( i did not know a  thing before and it was confusing and tricky) , now im working on graphs, learning the classic algorithms and practicing on it. After than i tend to keep on the usago GOLD roadmap , it is such a good ressource, going on math topics,( im the math guy ) ,  and practice on advanced data structures and math exercises. 

I believe me and my teammates managed fairly well these last weeks, even if it was a bit hard of us, and we are stil calling regularly to check some problems and train teamwork. 

I still need to learn cpp more ( so much TLE in python, while when i translate the code or AI helps me translate it , it passes) , i will for sure work more with that, even when learning a topic i prefer to focus on the algorithm rather than implementation.. 

In the video i will be covering much of these, but not all of them.
